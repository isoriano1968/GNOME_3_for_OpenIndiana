# GNOME_3_for_OpenIndiana
Make GNOME 3 available to OpenIndiana (borrowed from Solaris 11.4.42 CBE)

Welcome to the next quick and dirty approach to port GNOME 3 from Solaris to OpenIndiana as a valid alternative to the existing MATE desktop already existing in OpenIndiana.

The idea is leveraging solaris-userland's GNOME packages and adopt to oi-userland's build system and provide a fully installable pkg to the community.
